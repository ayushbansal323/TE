Assignment No. : 08

Problem Statement 1: Write a update, delete trigger on clientmstr table. The System should keep
track of the records that ARE BEING updated or deleted. The old value of updated or deleted
records should be added in audit_trade table. (separate implementation using both row and
statement triggers).
Solution:
Row trigger:
SQL> create or replace trigger t1 after update or delete on client_master 2
for each row
declare
op varchar(10);
begin
if updating then
op:='update';
end if;
if deleting then
op:='Delete';
end if;
into stat values(:old.id,op);
insert into audit_trade values(:old.id,:old.cname);
dbms_output.put_line('Details updated to stat and audit_trade table');
end;
/ Trigger created.



Statement Trigger:

SQL> create or replace trigger t1 after update or delete on client_master 2
for each row
declare
op varchar(10);
begin
if updating then
op:='update';
end if;
if deleting then
op:='Delete';
end if;
into stat values('',op);
insert into audit_trade values(:old.id,:old.cname);
dbms_output.put_line('Details updated to stat and audit_trade table');
end;
/ Trigger created.


Problem Statement 2: Write a before trigger for Insert, update event considering following
requirement: 

Emp(e_no, e_name, salary) I) Trigger action should be initiated when salary is tried to be
inserted is less than Rs. 50,000/- II) Trigger action should be initiated when salary is tried to be
updated for value less than Rs. 50,000/- Action should be rejection of update or Insert operation by
displaying appropriate error message. Also the new values expected to be inserted will be stored in new
table Tracking(e_no, salary).


Solution:

SQL> create or replace trigger t2 before insert or update of salary on emp
for each row
declare
msal number(10);
begin
msal:=:new.salary;
if msal<50000 then
raise_application_error(-20003,'Salary can not be less than 50000');
else
insert into tracking values(:new.eno,:new.salary);
dbms_output.put_line('Updation Successful');
end if;
end;
